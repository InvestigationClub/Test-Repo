In the beginning there was a lonely alligator who would wander the earth alone.
This alligator desired friends who would share in his interests and wander the earth beside him.
As the alligator wandered through the marsh one day, he met a frog.
"Hello dear friend" said the Alligator smiling at the frog.
"Greetings stranger" said the cautious frog who eyed the alligator up and down.
"I am but an alligator wandering and seeking adventure." He replied gleefully.
"And I am but a frog, seeking not to be eaten." the frog said with fear in his eyes.
The alligator paused for a moment and frowned looking at the frog. 
What seemed like an eternity passed and finally the frog broke the deafening silence.
"Strange wanderer, I must leave. My family calls me."
And so the frog left, leaving the alligator alone wondering why the rude frog would say such a thing.
